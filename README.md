👋 Hi there! I'm Felipe Sandoval, a multimedia systems engineer that loves many things. 

💬 Throughout my life, I've been drawn to a wide array of interests, seemingly distinct but truly interconnected. Code, art, UX design, and marketing strategies, all captivate me. I'm also passionate about 🆓 FLOSS (Free, Libre, Open Source Software) communities, 🎳 friends, 🎵 music, and 🦐 good food. 

🌱 I’m currently learning about automation, IA, and UX design.
